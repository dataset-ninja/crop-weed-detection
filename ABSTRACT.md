The objective of the **Crop and Weed Detection Data with Bounding Boxes** dataset is to create a system that accurately identifies and treats weeds, thus minimizing the risk of pesticide contamination on crops and reducing pesticide waste. The dataset comprises 1300 images featuring sesame crops and various weed types, each meticulously categorized. These images are presented in a 512x512 color format. Weeds are a common challenge in agriculture as they consume essential resources meant for crops, decreasing crop yields. To address this concern, farmers often resort to pesticide use, but this approach can inadvertently lead to pesticide residues on crops, potentially endangering consumer health.
