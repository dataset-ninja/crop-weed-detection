Weeds are a common nuisance in agriculture, siphoning vital resources away from crops and diminishing their productivity. To combat this issue, farmers frequently employ pesticides, but this method can inadvertently result in pesticide residues on the crops, posing potential health risks for consumers.

The aim of **Crop and weed detection data with bounding boxes** dataset is to develop a system designed to accurately target and apply pesticides solely to the weeds, thereby mitigating the risk of pesticide contamination on the crops and reducing pesticide wastage.

The dataset in question contains 1300 images featuring sesame crops and various weed varieties, each meticulously categorized. These images are presented in a 512x512 color format.
